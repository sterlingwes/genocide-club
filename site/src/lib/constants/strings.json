  "mission_statement": "Genocide.club seeks to archive public statements from those supporting Israel's mass displacement, starvation, and murder of Palestinians, and to contrast those statements with the human toll of Israel's campaign.",
  "hamas_acknowledge": "We acknowledge that on October 7th, Hamas invaded southern Israel and killed 1,139 Israelis & foreign nationals, including 764 civilians, and took 248 hostages. The toll of these initial actions has been dwarfed by Israel's response, so far killing {{gazaKilled}} and injuring {{gazaInjured}} Palestinians in Gaza as of {{lastReportDate}}. About {{gazaChildren}} of those killed were children, and {{gazaWomen}} were women. Beyond this human toll, Gaza has been largely levelled by large scale aerial bombardment which has destroyed critical civilian infrastructure including access to drinkable water, adequate shelter during the winter, and health care. Hundreds of thousands have been displaced from their homes.",
  "acknowledge_reason": "We focus on the timeframe of the latest hostilities so that we have a set period for which we can archive statements and contrast them with the human toll noted above as the days & months pass. By focusing on this time period we hope to show how disproportionate and indiscriminate Israel's response has been, and we hope to underscore how many influential people in our world do not view all human beings as equal or deserving of a life of dignity. We also want to acknowledge that these events are not an isolated occurrence and follow decades of oppression, harassment, attacks and displacement.",
  "mission_short": "We collect the public statements from those supporting Israel's mass displacement, starvation, and murder of Palestinians, and put them in context.",
